# unity-2dboids
A small graphical app that shows 2D boid simulation.

## How To Use
The BoidSettings scriptable objects has all the parameters that affect the simulation.
For example, there are two methods of execution:
- **Standard**: all the app's logic is handled with C# scripts
- **ComputeShader**: each boid's movement is calculated using a ComputeShader
